# simple_shodan_CIDR_search
Just a basic script to search a list of CIDR ranges with Shodan.io


Requirements:

shodan cli installed

shodan api key


This script will take a filename of "cidr_list.txt" and read each line, feeding it into a shodan search.
The results will be downloaded, and converted to excel

It's simple and basic, and saved me a lot of time.
